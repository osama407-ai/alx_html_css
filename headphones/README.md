# Headphones Landing Page Project ðŸŽ§

## About Me
Hi, I'm Thapelo â€” a curious soul blending code with creativity. I'm currently learning front-end development through ALX, and this project reflects both my growth and passion for building visually engaging, user-friendly websites.

I believe in design that speaks without shouting, structure that flows without forcing, and impact that reaches beyond pixels. Each HTML tag and CSS rule here is an echo of the discipline, creativity, and problem-solving Iâ€™ve embraced throughout this journey.

## What to Expect
This project is a fully responsive landing page built with pure HTML and CSSâ€”no frameworks, no shortcuts. Itâ€™s a step-by-step implementation based on a Figma design, with an emphasis on:

- **Clean structure & semantic HTML**  
  Every section is designed to be readable, accessible, and easy to maintain.

- **Custom styling without libraries**  
  CSS crafted from scratch, following best practices and design consistency.

- **Responsive behavior**  
  Mobile-first design that adapts gracefully to screen widths of 480px or less.

- **Interactive elements & animations**  
  From smooth hover effects to animated rowsâ€”UI that feels alive.

- **ccessibility conscious design** 
  Fonts, colors, and layout choices tuned for inclusivity.

This project is not just a taskâ€”it's a milestone in a larger journey to mastery. Welcome to my code canvas.
